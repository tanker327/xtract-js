## 🛑 Section 0: The Golden Rules of Prompting

Nano-Banana Pro is a "Thinking" model. It doesn't just match keywords; it understands intent, physics, and composition. To get the best results, stop using "tag soups" (e.g., dog, park, 4k, realistic) and start acting like a Creative Director.

## 1. Edit, Don't Re-roll

The model is exceptionally good at understanding conversational edits. If an image is 80% correct, do not generate a new one from scratch. Instead, simply ask for the specific change you need.

> Example: "That's great, but change the lighting to sunset and make the text neon blue."

## 2. Use Natural Language & Full Sentences

Talk to the model as if you were briefing a human artist. Use proper grammar and descriptive adjectives.

> ❌ Bad: "Cool car, neon, city, night, 8k."

> ✅ Good: "A cinematic wide shot of a futuristic sports car speeding through a rainy Tokyo street at night. The neon signs reflect off the wet pavement and the car's metallic chassis."

## 3. Be Specific and Descriptive

Vague prompts yield generic results. Define the subject, the setting, the lighting, and the mood.

> Subject: Instead of "a woman," say "a sophisticated elderly woman wearing a vintage chanel-style suit."

> Materiality: Describe textures. "Matte finish," "brushed steel," "soft velvet," "crumpled paper."

## 4. Provide Context (The "Why" or "For whom")

Because the model "thinks," giving it context helps it make logical artistic decisions.

> Example: "Create an image of a sandwich for a Brazilian high-end gourmet cookbook." (The model will infer professional plating, shallow depth of field, and perfect lighting).

# 1. Text Rendering, Infographics & Visual Synthesis

Nano-Banana Pro has SOTA capabilities for rendering legible, stylized text and synthesizing complex information into visual formats.

Best Practices:

- Compression: Ask the model to "compress" dense text or PDFs into visual aids.

- Style: Specify if you want a "polished editorial," a "technical diagram," or a "hand-drawn whiteboard" look.

- Quotes: Clearly specify the text you want in quotes.

Example Prompts:

> Earnings Report Infographic (Data Ingestion):
[Input PDF of Google's latest [earnings report](https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_news/2025/Oct/29/attachments/2025q3-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf)]
"Generate a clean, modern infographic summarizing the key financial highlights from this earnings report. Include charts for 'Revenue Growth' and 'Net Income', and highlight the CEO's key quote in a stylized pull-quote box."

---

## 2. Character Consistency & Viral Thumbnails

Nano-Banana Pro supports up to 14 reference images (6 with high fidelity). This allows for "Identity Locking"—placing a specific person or character into new scenarios without facial distortion.

Best Practices:

- Identity Locking: Explicitly state: "Keep the person's facial features exactly the same as Image 1."

- Expression/Action: Describe the change in emotion or pose while maintaining the identity.

- Viral Composition: Combine subjects with bold graphics and text in a single pass.

Example Prompts:

> The "Viral Thumbnail" (Identity + Text + Graphics):
"Design a viral video thumbnail using the person from Image 1. Face Consistency: Keep the person's facial features exactly the same as Image 1, but change their expression to look excited and surprised. Action: Pose the person on the left side, pointing their finger towards the right side of the frame. Subject: On the right side, place a high-quality image of a delicious avocado toast. Graphics: Add a bold yellow arrow connecting the person's finger to the toast. Text: Overlay massive, pop-style text in the middle: '3分钟搞定!' (Done in 3 mins!). Use a thick white outline and drop shadow. Background: A blurred, bright kitchen background. High saturation and contrast."

## 3. Grounding with Google Search

Nano-Banana Pro uses Google Search to generate imagery based on real-time data, current events, or factual verification, reducing hallucinations on timely topics.

Best Practices:

- Ask for visualizations of dynamic data (weather, stocks, news).

- The model will "Think" (reason) about the search results before generating the image.

Example Prompts:

> Event Visualization:
"Generate an infographic of the best times to visit the U.S. National Parks in 2025 based on current travel trends."

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G62_gI5agAAynni.jpg)

---

## 4. Advanced Editing, Restoration & Colorization

The model excels at complex edits via conversational prompting. This includes "In-painting" (removing/adding objects), "Restoration" (fixing old photos), "Colorization" (Manga/B&W photos), and "Style Swapping."

Best Practices:

- Semantic Instructions: You do not need to manually mask; simply tell the model what to change naturally.

- Physics Understanding: You can ask for complex changes like "fill this glass with liquid" to test physics generation.

Example Prompts:

> Object Removal & In-painting:
"Remove the tourists from the background of this photo and fill the space with logical textures (cobblestones and storefronts) that match the surrounding environment."

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G629lgMaAAAJFGW.jpg)

## 5. Dimensional Translation (2D ↔ 3D)

A powerful new capability is translating 2D schematics into 3D visualizations, or vice versa. This is ideal for interior designers, architects, and meme creators.

Example Prompts:

> 2D Floor Plan to 3D Interior Design Board:
"Based on the uploaded 2D floor plan, generate a professional interior design presentation board in a single image. Layout: A collage with one large main image at the top (wide-angle perspective of the living area), and three smaller images below (Master Bedroom, Home Office, and a 3D top-down floor plan). Style: Apply a Modern Minimalist style with warm oak wood flooring and off-white walls across ALL images. Quality: Photorealistic rendering, soft natural lighting."

## 6. High-Resolution & Textures

Nano-Banana Pro supports native 1K to 4K image generation. This is particularly useful for detailed textures or large-format prints.

Best Practices:

- Explicitly request high resolutions (2K or 4K) if your API/Interface allows.

- Describe high-fidelity details (imperfections, surface textures).

Example Prompts:

> 4K Texture Generation:
"Harness native high-fidelity output to craft a breathtaking, atmospheric environment of a mossy forest floor. Command complex lighting effects and delicate textures, ensuring every strand of moss and beam of light is rendered in pixel-perfect resolution suitable for a 4K wallpaper."

## 7. Thinking & Reasoning

Nano-Banana Pro defaults to a "Thinking" process where it generates interim thought images (not charged) to refine composition before rendering the final output. This allows for data analysis and solving visual problems.

Example Prompts:

> Solve Equations:
"Solve log_{x^2+1}(x^4-1)=2 in C on a white board. Show the steps clearly."

## 8. One-Shot Storyboarding & Concept Art

You can generate sequential art or storyboards without a grid, ensuring a cohesive narrative flow in a single session. This is also popular for "Movie Concept Art" (e.g., fake leaks of upcoming films).

Example Prompt:

> "Create an addictively intriguing 9-part story with 9 images featuring a woman and man in an award-winning luxury luggage commercial. The story should have emotional highs and lows, ending on an elegant shot of the woman with the logo. The identity of the woman and man and their attire must stay consistent throughout but they can and should be seen from different angles and distances. Please generate images one at a time. Make sure every image is in a 16:9 landscape format."

---

## 9. Structural Control & Layout Guidance

Input images aren't limited to character references or subjects to edit. You can use them to strictly control the composition and layout of the final output. This is a game-changer for designers who need to turn a napkin sketch, a wireframe, or a specific grid layout into a polished asset.

Best Practices:

- Drafts & Sketches: Upload a hand-drawn sketch to define exactly where the text and object should sit.

- Wireframes: Use screenshots of existing layouts or wireframes to generate high-fidelity UI mockups.

- Grids: Use grid images to force the model to generate assets for tile-based games or LED displays.

Example Prompts:

> Sketch to Final Ad:
